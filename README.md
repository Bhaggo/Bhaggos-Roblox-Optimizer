simple program created in batch to replace files in roblox that increases fps

Includes
* fps unlocker
* renderer changer
* max fps file from @BhaggoYT
* max graphics file from @BhaggoYT
* basic changes with renderer changer

Simple program so far, will update it regularly time to time and I will also create a complete revamp one day coded in C++ so it can work for mac users and also I would revamp if it gets a lot of downloads or something.

Jsons compiled using bloxstraps built in fast flag editor, please support them :) :https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap

# Instructions:

1. Download "Bhaggos Roblox Optimizer.exe" from the releases tab
2. Allow it to be kept on the computer
3. If the "Windows protected your PC" window shows up, click "More info" and then "Run Anyway"
4. Make sure you run this in admin so the ui of the app does not break
5. Follow steps on the youtube video provided: https://youtu.be/vgzzBgI9vt0
6. You're done with the process. You can always revert the changes through the app and if you want to uninstall, just uninstall the app by deleting the .bat file or the .exe file.

**If you are using bloxstrap, my files will not transfer over, make sure you change your default apps to open roblox links in your browser and make sure it opens the default roblox player beta.exe file.**
