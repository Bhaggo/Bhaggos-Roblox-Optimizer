simple program created in batch to replace files in roblox that increases fps

Includes
* fps unlocker
* renderer changer
* max fps file from @BhaggoYT
* max graphics file from @BhaggoYT
* basic changes with renderer changer

Simple program so far, will update it regularly time to time and I will also create a complete revamp one day coded in C++ so it can work for mac users and also I would revamp if it gets a lot of downloads or something.

Jsons compiled using bloxstrap, please support them :) :https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap
